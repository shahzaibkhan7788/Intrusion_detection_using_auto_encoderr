Intrusion Detection Using Autoencoders on the KDD Dataset
This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to detect network intrusions. Specifically, we use autoencoders to analyze the KDD dataset, which contains various features related to network traffic.

Project Overview
In this project, we aim to develop a model that can accurately detect intrusions in a network using the KDD dataset. Our primary method involves using autoencoders, which are a type of neural network designed for unsupervised learning.

Dataset
The KDD dataset consists of network traffic features collected from various sources. It includes several classes of network events, both normal and abnormal (intrusive). The dataset is used to train and evaluate the performance of our intrusion detection model.

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.
Model Design:
Implementing a single autoencoder for initial analysis.
Evaluating model performance using precision, recall, accuracy, and confusion matrix.
Performance Analysis:
Identifying biases and shortcomings in the initial model.
Implementing an ensemble of autoencoders to improve performance.
Evaluation:
Analyzing the performance of the ensemble model using standard metrics.
Results
The initial model using a single autoencoder showed promising results but was affected by data bias.
Implementing an ensemble of autoencoders significantly improved the detection accuracy and overall performance.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using autoencoders and ensemble methods in detecting network intrusions. It highlights the importance of addressing data bias and exploring multiple models to achieve optimal results.
